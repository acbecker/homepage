description: Description of Past and Current Research Interests for Andrew Becker

<h1>Research</h1>
<hr/>
<h2>Background</h2>

My primary interests have been in developing new statistical and
computational techniques to enable the analysis of high-dimensional
astrophysical data.  This includes image processing algorithms at the
pixel level, through filtering of data streams for real-time analysis,
to retrospective analyses of large-scale databases for trends and
outliers.  This has been done in collaboration with hundreds of
scientists from around the world, and has occurred at the boundary of
big data / big compute in the field of astronomy, from its inception
in the mid-1990s to developing future surveys that will see first
light in 2010.  <hr/>
 

<h2>Research Interests</h2>

<ul>
<li><b>Dark Matter</b><br> 

I have participated in several investigations into the nature and
extent of the dark matter that composes 27% of the total mass of our
Universe.  The first was the focus of my thesis work with the MACHO
project.  Our challenge was to filter 10^7 lightcurves to find rare
microlensing events that numbered in the tens
(<a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2000ApJ...542..281A">Alcock et
al., 2000</a>).  We were one of the first wide-field surveys that
reduced our data in real-time, which began in earnest the era of
"big-data" in Astronomy, where "big" means an accumulated database of
200 Gb in the year 2000.  I have since participated in the next
generation <a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2005IAUS..225..357B">Super-MACHO</a>
microlensing experiment, and supernova cosmology experiments that
also constrain the dark matter content of the Universe.
</li>

<li><b>Dark Energy</b><br> 

Supernova cosmology experiments constrain both the dark matter and
dark energy content of the Universe, the latter of which lead to the
2011 Nobel Prize in Physics for two of my collaborators, Adam Riess
and Brian Schmidt.  I have worked on second generation supernova
cosmology experiments to constrain the nature of the dark energy, in
particular its equation of state, with both
the <a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2007ApJ...666..694W">ESSENCE</a>
and <a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2009ApJS..185...32K">SDSS-II</a>
supernova surveys.  In both projects, my involvement included the
real-time filtering of data and visualization/validation of the
real-time data stream.
</li>

<li><b>Exoplanets</b><br> 

I have recently been investigating the limits of precision in
ground-based and space-based astronomy through the study of planets
around other stars, a.k.a. "exoplanets".  This includes ground-based
observations of known exoplanet systems with
the <a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2011ApJ...731..123K">APOSTLE</a> <a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2013ApJ...764L..17B">project</a>,
which I am the PI for.  I also have been working on detrending and
modeling the data from the Kepler spacecraft, which present some of
the highest precision astronomical time-series that have ever been
acquired.
</li>

<li><b>Large Synoptic Survey Telescope</b><br> 

I have spent the past 8 years working towards defining the scope of,
and validating the algorithms behind,
the <a href="http://www.lsst.org/lsst/">Large Synoptic Survey
Telescope</a>, the future of our field.  This includes creating the
data inputs for, and the mining of, 4-billion row databases to assess
the quality of algorithms.  This project is slated to begin
construction in fiscal year 2014.
</li>

</ul>

<h2>Current</h2>
<ul>

<li><b>Time Domain Analytics</b><br>

My focus going forward is to hone my expertise in time domain
analytics to develope a classification and predictive infrastructure
for vector-valued time sequences of data.  The most relevant example
of this would be classifying variable stars based on their
multi-passband lightcurves.  But this idea is general enough that a
well-designed platform will have relevance beyond the astrophysical.
