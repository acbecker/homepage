<h2>Pacific Science Center Discovery Corps Program</h2>
<p>
For the past 2 summers, I have hosted high-school age students for a quarter of intensive coding and science.  These students are part of the Pacific Science Center
<a href="http://www.pacificsciencecenter.org/Discovery-Corps/discoverycorps">Discovery Corps</a> program.  I have also provided lectures to the entire group of students on Exoplanets and Other Worlds.  Fun stuff!

<h2>NSF Faculty and Student Teams (FaST) Program</h2>
<p>
In summer 2008 we started a program to increase diversity in the Large Synpotic Survey Telescope 
<a href="http://www.lsst.org/lsst/">(LSST)</a> 
Collaboration.  I lead a team at UW, and we also had teams at Brookhaven National Lab (BNL) and Stanford (SLAC).  At UW we had the pleasure of working with 
<a href="http://www.fit.edu/faculty/profiles/profile.html?value=433"> Dr. Hakeem Oluseyi</a> 
from the Florida Institute of Technology for an intensive 9 week program.  This project continued for 3 summers, and culminated in our 
<a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2012AJ....144....9O">paper</a>
describing the ability of the LSST to recover RR Lyrae periods as a function of both time and stellar brightness.  You can read about our research in the 
<a href="http://www.lsst.org/News/enews/200910.html">LSST Newsletter</a>.
Our good-looking 2008 and 2009 teams:

<h2>Pre-Major in Astronomy Program (Pre-MAP)</h2>
<p>
I actively participate in the University of Washington "Pre-Major in Astronomy Program"
(<a href="http://www.astro.washington.edu/premap/">Pre-MAP</a>), 
which provides research opportunities for traditionally underrepresented freshmen. Pre-MAP is designed to reinforce interest in science and astronomy in minorities and women. It also provides an important venue for one-on-one interaction between student and scientist in what is traditionally an anonymous and daunting freshman year at a large University. I have worked with 2 cohorts of students from orientation to their graduations, each a 4-year process in which the students do science-grade resarch.  I encourage all students to participate in the UW 
<a href="http://www.washington.edu/research/urp/symp/">Undergraduate Research Symposium</a>.  
This provides an opportunity for exposure and resume building starting in the first year of college, an important milestone for keeping the students excited about science and confident in their ability to work in the field.

Here is my first set of students at the Symposium:<br>

Along with the second cohort, we were able able detect several thousand new asteroids in the SDSS data, with some nice PR
