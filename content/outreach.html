<h2>Pre-Major in Astronomy Program (Pre-MAP)</h2>
<p>
I actively participate in the University of Washington "Pre-Major in Astronomy Program" (Pre-MAP), which provides research opportunities for traditionally underrepresented freshmen. Pre-MAP is designed to reinforce interest in science and astronomy in minorities and women. It also provides an important venue for one-on-one interaction between student and scientist in what is traditionally an anonymous and daunting freshman year at a large University. I have worked with 2 cohorts of students from orientation to their graduations, each a 4-year process, in which they are able to do science-grade resarch.  I encourage all students to participate in the UW 
<a href="http://www.washington.edu/research/urp/symp/">Undergraduate Research Symposium</a>.  
This provides an opportunity for exposure and resume building starting in the first year of college, an important milestone for keeping the students excited about science and confident in their ability to work in the field.

Here is my first set of students at the Symposium:

Along with the second cohort, we were able able detect several thousand new asteroids in the SDSS data, with some nice PR
